# Belly Button Biodiversity
Creating Interactive Dashboards to display Data using Plotly and JavaScript

## Project Overview
***Background:***

In efforts to study more about bacteria species that synthesize proteins to taste like beef, we were asked to create an interactive dashboard on a webpage to help fellow researchers and/ participants see the data. As a hypothesis, it is believed that the ideal bacterial species to make the best synthetic beef comes from the human belly button. To test this hypothesis, belly buttons were tested to identify the different bacterias in each subject's belly button. Each subject that was tested was given a unique ID number. 

***Purpose:*** 
Through this project, we are learning to use Plotly, JavaScript, and Github to clearly communicate our data results. Specifically, we learned to: 

- Create basic plots with Plotly, including bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.
- Use D3.json() to fetch external data, such as CSV files and web APIs.
- Parse data in JSON format.
- Use functional programming in JavaScript to manipulate data.
- Use JavaScript's Math library to manipulate numbers.
- Use event handlers in JavaScript to add interactivity to a data visualization.
- How to use interactivity to enhance your visualizations.
- Deploy an interactive chart to GitHub Pages.
